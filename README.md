# TEMPy: a CLI for cleaning your Windows temporary files

![TEMPy logo]("assets/tempy.png")

TEMPy is a **command line** utility intended for keeping your windows machine happy. Just run a command in your terminal every 10 seconds, week, year (please don't), or whenever you want and that's it your temp files are gone. Simple and fast.

TEMPy is written in python paired with the awesome [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/) library, so it's not windows only. You can run it in Linux or Mac, don't know why, but it's possible.

## Features
* Intuitive commands
* Temp directory content in tree view
* Temp directory content in ASCII tables (like MySQL or PostgreSQL shell)
* Temp directory size and total files
* Log file with detailed data of the performed deletions

## Installation
Tempy can be installed with pip with the command:
```
pip install tempy
```
Make sure pip and setuptools are up to date.

## Usage
The general command structure is:
```
tempy [COMMAND] [OPTION]
```

| `delete`      | `--se`       | Shows all errors that were encountered in the last deletion |

```
tempy delete --se
```
```
